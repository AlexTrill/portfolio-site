            <h2>1. Project Overview & Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
              In the tactically demanding environment of Serie A, robust
              defensive structures are paramount. This project aims to
              objectively quantify individual defender performance and compare
              it against player wages to identify undervalued talent. A primary
              challenge was the absence of objective, normalized metrics for
              equitable player comparison. Raw statistics are often misleading
              as they don't account for differing playtime or a team's
              possession-based strategy, which significantly impacts a
              defender's engagement and statistical volume. This analysis
              tackles these issues to provide a fairer assessment for scouting
              and recruitment.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Data Cleaning & Initial Processing Steps:</h3>
            <p>
              I implemented my cleaning and initial processing using a combination of SQL and Python, ensuring accuracy,
              consistency, and suitability for robust analysis. Key steps
              included:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Initial Data Structuring & Formatting:</strong> I
                corrected header columns, converted them to snake_case for
                consistency, and removed unnecessary columns. Specific data
                extractions were performed, such as parsing USD amounts from
                wage strings and converting Euros to USD using a 1.03 exchange
                rate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Quality & Blank Handling:</strong> I identified
                and converted blank cells/rows to 0 where appropriate,
                preventing issues during numerical operations and database
                import.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Player & Data Normalization for Integration (Python &
                  Google Sheets):</strong
                >
                A Python script was used to handle and convert non-standard
                regex characters in player names, crucial for seamless import
                into SQL. I also split position columns (e.g., "CB,DM") into
                separate fields to better categorize players.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Filtering & Qualification:</strong> The dataset was
                filtered to include only defenders. To ensure
                statistical reliability and account for sufficient playtime,
                players with fewer than
                <strong
                  >1140 minutes played</strong
                >
                were removed from the analysis. This threshold was chosen to focus on players with significant playing time, roughly equivalent to 12 full matches in a season (1140 minutes), ensuring their data meaningfully contributes to the analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Handling Duplicate Player Records & Aggregation:</strong>
                Players who played for multiple teams in a season had separate
                data rows; I identified these duplicates and combined their
                records. For wage data, I implemented logic to sum
                wages if players had different salaries from multiple clubs, or
                kept them consistent if salaries were the same across loan
                spells.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Loading & Validation:</strong> After cleaning, I
                loaded the prepared datasets into SQL tables. I performed
                VLOOKUP checks between datasets (e.g., player stats and wages)
                to ensure all players were correctly matched and linked across
                sources, confirming data integrity before analysis.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Key Python Scripts for Data Acquisition & Pre-processing:</h3>
            <p>
              To gather comprehensive data and ensure its readiness for
              analysis, I developed custom Python scripts. These scripts were
              essential for automating data extraction from various web sources
              that lacked direct APIs, and for standardizing text data that
              contained non-standard characters and diacritics.
            </p>

            <h4>Web Scraping Snippet (Example from FBref Data Collection):</h4>
            <p>
              This snippet illustrates the core logic used in my web scraping
              scripts to extract structured table data from web pages using
              Selenium. Similar patterns were applied to collect core defensive,
              passing, and wage statistics from sources such as FBref.

            <h2>3. Methodology & Feature Engineering</h2>
            <p>
              To create the robust "Defender Score" and "Value Score," data was
              further processed and transformed, with the core feature
              engineering, statistical normalization, and scoring logic
              primarily implemented in <strong>R</strong>. This rigorous process
              ensured fair comparison and contextualized performance, moving
              beyond raw statistics:
            </p>

            <h3>Key Feature Engineering Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Per-90 Conversion:</strong> Raw statistical volumes were
                converted to per-90 minute metrics to account for varying
                playtime, allowing for direct comparison regardless of time on
                the field.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Possession Adjustment:</strong> Player statistics were lightly
                adjusted based on their team's average possession percentage.
                This corrects for the fact that a defender on a low-possession
                team naturally has more defensive opportunities. For example, a
                defender on a low-possession team might have fewer tackles
                simply due to less engagement, so metrics were scaled relative
                to the team's average possession, providing a more contextually
                fair evaluation of their engagement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Standardization (Z-Scores):</strong> All relevant
                metrics were standardized using z-scores. This transforms data
                onto a common scale (mean of 0, standard deviation of 1),
                enabling direct comparison across diverse statistical
                categories. Negative metrics (e.g., errors leading to goal, lost
                aerial duels) were inverted before standardization so that a higher
                z-score consistently indicated better performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Defender Score Calculation:</strong> A composite
                "Defender Score" for each player was calculated by summing their
                standardized z-scores across a selection of 9 core defensive
                performance metrics. This approach ensures a player's score
                represents their overall defensive contribution relative to the
                league average, where a higher score signifies an above average 
                performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Value Score Calculation:</strong> A "Value Score" was
                then derived by comparing the composite "Defender Score" against
                publicly available estimated player wages. A lower 'Value Score'
                indicates a more cost-effective player, providing high defensive
                output for a relatively lower salary.
              </li>
            </ol>

              This R script snippet demonstrates the core transformations and calculations
              for per-90 conversion, possession adjustment, z-score standardization, and
              the final composite "Defender Score" and "Value Score" derivations.

            <p>
              The analysis culminated in identifying high-impact defenders
              relative to their cost. The interactive Tableau Public dashboard
              below allows for dynamic exploration of player profiles,
              performance metrics, and value rankings based on the calculated
              scores.

            <h2>5. Key Insights & Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Identified several 'undervalued' defenders who provided
                significant defensive output at a relatively lower cost.
              </li>
              <li>
                Highlighted that traditional scouting might overlook players who
                excel in less glamorous defensive roles but are highly
                impactful.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> Relied on publicly available
                data, which may not capture all nuances. Wage data can be
                estimates. Focus was primarily on quantifiable defensive
                actions, not qualitative aspects like leadership or tactical
                intelligence.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Python:</strong> Pandas (data manipulation), Selenium
                (web scraping), unicodedata (text normalization).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Google Sheets:</strong> Initial data review and minor
                transformations.
              </li>
              <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>R:</strong> Dplyr (data manipulation, feature
                engineering), ggplot2 (static visualization), plotly
                (interactive visualization).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tableau:</strong> Interactive dashboard creation and
                visualization.
              </li>
              
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Conclusion & Future Work</h2>
            <p>
              This project aimed to demonstrate an end-to-end analytical
              workflow, from raw data to actionable insights and interactive
              visualization. It provides a robust framework for identifying
              efficient defensive talent in football.

              <li>
                Integrate qualitative scouting reports for a more holistic
                assessment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Explore the application of weighted metrics for a more nuanced
                'Defender Score' to reflect varying importance of different
                defensive actions.
